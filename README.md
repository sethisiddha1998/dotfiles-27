## Vim dotfiles

These are the vim runtime files that I use on a daily basis.

## Usage

**NOTE**: If you have existing files in `$HOME/.vim` or `$HOME/.vimrc`, make sure you take appropriate backups before performing any of the following steps.

 - First install Vundle, as per their [instructions](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```

 - Next, get the dotfiles

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:vdraceil/dotfiles.git
```

 - Next, install all Plugins through Vundle
